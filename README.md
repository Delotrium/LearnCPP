# LearnCPP

This is the repository where Im going to place all the code I write on learning C++. I will go from basics, to full-out projects , documenting everything on the way.
I will try to comment on the code as much as possible to show  understanding, and so readers can understand and learn all the code. I will add more to this file as I go through.

##Files:

**Code/Learn_1:**

This program is a simple hello world program for C++. This introduces the std::cout function, and the use of the main function.

**Code/Learn_2:**
Learn the basics of creating functions and how to use them. In the program the code returns what 10^2 is, then allows the user to input a base and exponent to calculate the power function. It introduces a very basic function from cmath.

**Code/Learn_3:**
This program introduces the idea of void functions. The program is similar to the program before in which the program returns 10^2, and allows the user to input a base and exponential to calculate the power. This time the use of void functions are apparent which calculates everything without needing to be returned into memory.

**Code/Learn_4:**
This program lists all the basic datatypes and explains the uses of them. Furthermore, the program explains in detail Integers and characters. The code explains all the different types of integers and characters, stating the amount of bytes each type of datatype occupies. Also, the Climits library is used to show the minimum and maximum value a datatype can occupy. The program also elaborates on ASCII, and how characters can either store literal numbers, or an Letter using the ASCII equivalent.

###Code/Learn_5:
This is a simple program listing the definitions and uses of various escape sequences that are commonly used in strings.

###Code/Learn_6
Booleans in Detail.

<This will be updated about every week, so some newer files may not be located in this README file. Descriptions can still be found on the actual files though>
