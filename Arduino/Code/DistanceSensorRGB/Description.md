# Description

## Basic Use
This code lights an RGB LED with a colour representing the distance that an object is from the Ultrasonic Distance Sensor. For example, when an object is between 100-200 cm, 
the light will shine Blue. The circuit can be used as an application in several ways, such as a warning light for reversing a vehicle or measuring distance for construction
applications. Feel free to copy and change the code; however, reference this code for commercial and industrial uses.
